## Chest X-Ray Multi-Label Classification via Deep Convolutional Neural Networks

**Team:**
* Andrew Dant
* Alicia Hernandez

**Course:** DAAN 897â€“ Deep Learning (Spring II, 2020)

### Problem Statement
*  Our goal is to further existing research using deep learning for medical diagnosis and apply it to a dataset comprised of chest X-rays and associated patient data using previously established deep convolutional neural networks. We used transfer learning techniques to train a variety of machine learning models to classify 15 different diseases present in the x ray images.

### Data Collection
* Source(url): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nih-chest-xrays/data
* Short Description : 112,120 X-ray images with disease labels from 30,805 unique patients

#### The dataset is very large (44 gb) so we could not include it with our submission. Please visit the source url and click the download button. Once the download has finished you must extract the zip file and point the 'path' variable in the notebook file to the correct directory where the dataset was extracted.

### Required packages
In order to run this project you must have the following python packages installed:
numpy
pandas
tensorflow (with keras)
sklearn
matplotlib
